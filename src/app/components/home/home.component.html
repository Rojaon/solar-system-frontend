        <h2 class="text1">The major constituents of the solar system include eight recognized planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each planet has its own unique characteristics, such as size, composition, and atmospheric conditions. Earth, the third planet from the Sun, sustains life and is distinguished by its diverse ecosystems, oceans, and a protective atmosphere.</h2>

        <h2 class="text2">In addition to planets, the solar system contains numerous moons, some of which are substantial worlds in their own right. Moons exhibit a variety of features, including craters, mountains, and even atmospheres. For instance, Earth's moon plays a crucial role in influencing tides and stabilizing Earth's axial tilt.</h2>

        <h2 class="text3">Moons are natural satellites that orbit planets, dwarf planets, or other celestial bodies within our solar system. They come in various sizes and compositions, ranging from large, geologically active moons to smaller, irregularly shaped ones. Earth's moon is a well-known example, providing a familiar object in our night sky.</h2>
